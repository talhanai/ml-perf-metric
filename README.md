# ml-perf-metric
This repo contains a python script to calculate standard performance metrics used in machine learning applications.

The file **myfunctions.py** contains two methods:
- **perfMetrics(pred,Y)** which takes the predictions (pred) and true labels (Y) to calculate:

    AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve).
    OPT_ER: Optimum Point on the ROC.
    EER (Equal Error Rate): Operating point on ROC for equal True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate.
    Accuracy: Correct classification, when the probability threshold is set to 0.5 for classification between binary classes
    TP (True Positive): Number of observations in positive class (i.e. class of interest) correctly as positive class.
    FP (False Positive): Number of observations in negative class wrongly predicted as positive.
    TN (True Negative): Number of observations in negative class correctly predicted as negative.
    FN (False Negative): Number of observations in negative class wrongly predicted as negative.
    FPR (False Positive Rate): Out of all the negative observations, the percentage of which were wrongly predicted positive.
    TPR (True Positive Rate) : Out of all the positive observations, the percentage of which were correctly predicted positive.
    Recall : (Same as True Positive Rate).
    Precision: Out of all positive predictions, the the percentage of which were correctly predicted positive.
    F1_score : The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
    TPR_when_FPR0p10 : True Positive Rate at 10% False Positive Rate.
    TPR_when_FPR0p05 : True Positive Rate at 5% False Positive Rate.
    TPR_when_FPR0 : True Positive Rate at 0% False Positive Rate.
    FPR_when_TPR0p90 : False Positive Rate at 90% True Positive Rate.
    FPR_when_TPR0p95 : False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate.
    FPR_when_TPR1p00 : False Positive Rate at 100% True Positive Rate.
    HL_test (Hosmer-Lemeshow Test) : evaluates goodness-of-fit of model, i.e. if the model predicts 10% probability of a positive class for an observation, is the model correctly predicting the positive class 10% of the time?
